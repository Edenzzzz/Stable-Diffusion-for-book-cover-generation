 is outdated. `steps_offset` should be set to 1 instead of 0. Please make sure to update the config accordingly as leaving `steps_offset` might led to incorrect results in future versions. If you have downloaded this checkpoint from the Hugging Face Hub, it would be very nice if you could open a Pull request for the `scheduler/scheduler_config.json` file
  deprecate("steps_offset!=1", "1.0.0", deprecation_message, standard_warn=False)
You have disabled the safety checker for <class 'diffusers.pipelines.stable_diffusion.pipeline_stable_diffusion.StableDiffusionPipeline'> by passing `safety_checker=None`. Ensure that you abide to the conditions of the Stable Diffusion license and do not expose unfiltered results in services or applications open to the public. Both the diffusers team and Hugging Face strongly recommend to keep the safety filter enabled in all public facing circumstances, disabling it only for use-cases that involve analyzing network behavior or auditing its results.

["A  book cover with author: Alicia Howard, book title: Street Bitches Don't Need Love 2 , and abstract Hurricane succeeds at her plan to force Rashida into a mental institution. This leaves Taz with no choice but to put his children in the care of the last person Rashida would expect or accept. Taz feels he has no options since he has to find a new connect because Pablo refuses to deal with him. He delegates this task to Craig. Craig's drug usage is spiraling out of control. He has become more of a fiend than a hustler. Liking the sample he tested previously, he decides to reach out to the dealer and see if he could potentially become their new plug. However, Craig isn't aware that dealing with this guy may cost the lives of him and his team. Hurricane withdraws from WC and it is starting to piss him off. His anger is not directed towards her, but towards the cause of her problems. He decides to go after Taz and his crew to eliminate the cause of Hurricane's pain. WC recruits his brother who has more ties to the situation than anyone knows. Unbeknownst to WC, Hurricane is also working on a takedown of her own. This installment has more twists and turns, and revealed secrets. Which side will come out on top or which side will take losses due to those secrets. Read and find out.
